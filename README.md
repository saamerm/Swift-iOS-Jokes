# IOS Swift Jokes

## Introduction
This repo is a great way to learn how to use a RESTful API to populate a UICollectionView programmatically, as part of an unpublished article here: https://medium.com/@prototypemakers/create-a-jokes-app-programmatically-using-uicollectionviews-part-1-87b7979c504a

There are a lot of tutorials on doing this with a UITableView but not a UICollectionView. The ICNDB free API is a great tool to practice with RESTful APIâ€™s. You can follow the steps in the article to recreate this app.
